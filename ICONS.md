# Icons

Icons on this site use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev) for static HTML. Hover motion is inspired by **[Its Hover](https://github.com/itshover/itshover)** — *Icons that move with intent* ([itshover.com](https://itshover.com)).

Its Hover is an animated icon library built with React and [motion/react](https://motion.dev); it does not ship a static SVG or script build for plain HTML. This project applies the same “move with intent” idea via CSS hover transitions (e.g. scale on hover) so icons feel responsive without React.
